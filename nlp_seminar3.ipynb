Therefore, its' perplexity will be lower than it should when encountering such words. Therefore, comparing it with a model with fewer unknown words will not be fair. When implementing your own smoothing, you may handle this by adding a virtual `UNK` token of non-zero probability. Technically, this will result in a model where probabilities do not add up to $1$, but it is close enough for a practice excercise."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellId":"3xvxkdxcmfqucruyt66mdc","id":"euDV_wZXTzCa","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1707990905623,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":514,"user":{"displayName":"Anna Chernova","userId":"05759544138678713523"}},"outputId":"ccb575a6-e1aa-4738-ee2d-7032d57ce4c8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 100/100 [00:00<00:00, 27310.22it/s]\n","100%|██████████| 100/100 [00:00<00:00, 22948.54it/s]\n","100%|██████████| 100/100 [00:00<00:00, 14629.08it/s]\n"]}],"source":["#test that it's a valid probability model\n","for n in (1, 2, 3):\n","    dummy_lm = LaplaceLanguageModel(dummy_lines, n=n)\n","    assert np.allclose(sum([dummy_lm.get_next_token_prob('a', w_i) for w_i in dummy_lm.vocab]), 1), \"I told you not to break anything! :)\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellId":"j6zqa50koitjjri9ipd8ec","id":"oBrdoPAeTzCb","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1707991109514,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":78477,"user":{"displayName":"Anna Chernova","userId":"05759544138678713523"}},"outputId":"91968d90-8801-46e5-f778-4028faf629a3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 30750/30750 [00:03<00:00, 7987.25it/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["N = 1, Perplexity = 1032.76595\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 30750/30750 [00:07<00:00, 4224.40it/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["N = 2, Perplexity = 486.02044\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 30750/30750 [00:12<00:00, 2404.38it/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["N = 3, Perplexity = 3842.49083\n"]}],"source":["for n in (1, 2, 3):\n","    lm = LaplaceLanguageModel(train_lines, n=n, delta=0.1)\n","    ppx = perplexity(lm, test_lines)\n","    print(\"N = %i, Perplexity = %.5f\" % (n, ppx))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellId":"pjuqt30jcerwbz1ym9zv1","id":"F9_y9RCYTzCb"},"outputs":[],"source":["# optional: try to sample tokens from such a model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cellId":"3b8s1y9uls4fosu3yp28gg","id":"4Olh1r_7TzCb"},"source":["### Kneser-Ney smoothing (2 points)\n","\n","Additive smoothing is simple, reasonably good but definitely not a State of The Art algorithm.\n","\n","\n","Your final task in this notebook is to implement [Kneser-Ney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneser%E2%80%93Ney_smoothing) smoothing.\n","\n","It can be computed recurrently, for n>1:\n","\n","$$P_{kn}(w_t | prefix_{n-1}) = { \\max(0, Count(prefix_{n-1}, w_t) - \\delta) \\over \\sum_{\\hat w} Count(prefix_{n-1}, \\hat w)} + \\lambda_{prefix_{n-1}} \\cdot P_{kn}(w_t | prefix_{n-2})$$\n","\n","where\n","- $prefix_{n-1}$ is a tuple of {n-1} previous tokens\n","- $lambda_{prefix_{n-1}}$ is a normalization constant chosen so that probabilities add up to 1\n","- Unigram $P_{kn}(w_t | prefix_{n-2})$ corresponds to Kneser Ney smoothing for {N-1}-gram language model.\n","- Unigram $P_{kn}(w_t)$ is a special case: how likely it is to see x_t in an unfamiliar context\n","\n","See lecture slides or wiki for more detailed formulae.\n","\n","__Your task__ is to\n","- implement `KneserNeyLanguageModel` class,\n","- test it on 1-3 gram language models\n","- find optimal (within reason) smoothing delta for 3-gram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellId":"2ix7kzw02v30oye55322all","id":"t5hNZXfZTzCc"},"outputs":[],"source":["class KneserNeyLanguageModel(NGramLanguageModel):\n","    \"\"\" A template for Kneser-Ney language model.
